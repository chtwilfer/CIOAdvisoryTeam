Conducting a technology audit is an important step in assessing an **organization's current IT landscape**. 

A technology audit typically involves the following steps:
- Identify the scope of the audit: The CIO advisory team should determine which systems, hardware, and software will be included in the audit. This may include servers, storage systems, networks, applications, and devices.
- Collect data: The CIO advisory team should gather data on the systems and technologies included in the audit. This may include information such as system configurations, software versions, and usage patterns. Data can be collected through manual inspections, automated tools, or a combination of both.
- Analyze the data: Once the data is collected, the CIO advisory team should analyze it to identify any issues or problems. This may include identifying outdated software, security vulnerabilities, or capacity constraints.
- Create a report: The CIO advisory team should then create a report that summarizes the findings of the audit. The report should include a summary of the systems and technologies audited, an assessment of their current state, and recommendations for improvements.
- Review the report with stakeholders: The CIO advisory team should review the report with key stakeholders, including the organization's leadership team, IT staff, and business leaders. This will help ensure that everyone is aware of the report's findings and recommendations.
- Develop an action plan: Using the report's recommendations the CIO advisory team and stakeholders can develop an action plan to address any issues or problems identified during the audit.

It's important to note that the technology audit should be conducted periodically to ensure that the organization's IT landscape stays up-to-date and aligned with the organization's business goals. 


## Identifying the Scope##
**Identifying the scope** of a technology audit is an important step in ensuring that all relevant systems, hardware, and software are included in the audit. The CIO advisory team should consider the following when determining the scope of the audit:

- Systems: The CIO advisory team should identify all the systems that need to be included in the audit. This may include servers, storage systems, networks, and cloud-based systems.

- Hardware: The CIO advisory team should identify all the hardware that needs to be included in the audit. This may include desktops, laptops, mobile devices, and other endpoints.

- Software: The CIO advisory team should identify all the software that needs to be included in the audit. This may include operating systems, applications, and other software tools.

- Data: The CIO advisory team should identify all the data that needs to be included in the audit. This may include data stored in databases, files, and cloud storage.

- Users: The CIO advisory team should identify all the users that need to be included in the audit. This may include employees, contractors, and other third-party users.

- Locations: The CIO advisory team should identify all the physical locations that need to be included in the audit. This may include offices, data centers, and remote locations.

It's important to note that the scope of the audit should be clearly defined and communicated to all relevant stakeholders so that everyone is aware of what systems, hardware, software, data, users, and locations are being audited.


## ollect Data ##
Collecting data is an important step in a technology audit as it provides a comprehensive view of the organization's current IT systems, hardware, and software. The CIO advisory team should consider the following when collecting data:

- System configurations: The CIO advisory team should gather data on the configurations of the systems included in the audit. This may include information such as the number of processors, memory, and storage.

- Software versions: The CIO advisory team should gather data on the versions of the software included in the audit. This may include information such as the version numbers of operating systems, applications, and other software tools.

- Usage patterns: The CIO advisory team should gather data on the usage patterns of the systems and technologies included in the audit. This may include information such as the number of users, the frequency of usage, and the types of tasks being performed.

- Security controls: The CIO advisory team should gather data on the security controls that are in place for the systems and technologies included in the audit. This may include information such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint protection software.

- Manual inspections: The CIO advisory team can gather data through manual inspections, such as physically visiting data centers and inspecting servers, storage systems, and other hardware.

- Automated tools: The CIO advisory team can gather data through automated tools, such as network scanners, security vulnerability scanners, and system management software.

- Combination of both: The CIO advisory team may use a combination of manual inspections and automated tools to gather data.

It's important to note that the data collected should be accurate and consistent, and should be collected in a way that preserves the integrity of the systems and technologies included in the audit.
