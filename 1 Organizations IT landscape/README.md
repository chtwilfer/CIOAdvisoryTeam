Conducting a technology audit is an important step in assessing an **organization's current IT landscape**. 

A technology audit typically involves the following steps:
- Identify the scope of the audit: The CIO advisory team should determine which systems, hardware, and software will be included in the audit. This may include servers, storage systems, networks, applications, and devices.
- Collect data: The CIO advisory team should gather data on the systems and technologies included in the audit. This may include information such as system configurations, software versions, and usage patterns. Data can be collected through manual inspections, automated tools, or a combination of both.
- Analyze the data: Once the data is collected, the CIO advisory team should analyze it to identify any issues or problems. This may include identifying outdated software, security vulnerabilities, or capacity constraints.
- Create a report: The CIO advisory team should then create a report that summarizes the findings of the audit. The report should include a summary of the systems and technologies audited, an assessment of their current state, and recommendations for improvements.
- Review the report with stakeholders: The CIO advisory team should review the report with key stakeholders, including the organization's leadership team, IT staff, and business leaders. This will help ensure that everyone is aware of the report's findings and recommendations.
- Develop an action plan: Using the report's recommendations the CIO advisory team and stakeholders can develop an action plan to address any issues or problems identified during the audit.

It's important to note that the technology audit should be conducted periodically to ensure that the organization's IT landscape stays up-to-date and aligned with the organization's business goals.
