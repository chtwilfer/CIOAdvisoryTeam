Helping to develop and implement a **cybersecurity strategy** to protect an organization from cyber threats is a critical aspect of a CIO advisory team's role. The following are some key steps in the process:
- Assess the organization's current cybersecurity posture: The CIO advisory team should assess the organization's current cybersecurity posture to identify any vulnerabilities or risks. This includes reviewing security controls, identifying potential threats, and assessing the organization's ability to respond to a cyber incident.
- Understand the regulatory environment: The CIO advisory team should understand the regulatory environment and any laws and regulations that apply to the organization's industry and the data it handles.
- Develop a cybersecurity strategy: Using the information gathered in the assessment, the CIO advisory team should work with the organization to develop a cybersecurity strategy that aligns with the regulatory environment and the organization's business goals. The strategy should include a plan for identifying, preventing, and responding to cyber threats.
- Implement security controls: The CIO advisory team should work with the organization to implement security controls that align with the cybersecurity strategy. This may include implementing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint protection software.
- Communicate and train: The CIO advisory team should communicate the cybersecurity strategy and any changes to security controls to all relevant stakeholders, including the leadership team, IT staff, and business leaders. The CIO advisory team should also provide training to ensure that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities in maintaining the security of the organization's systems and data.
- Monitor and evaluate: The CIO advisory team should continuously monitor the organization's cybersecurity posture and evaluate the effectiveness of the cybersecurity strategy. This includes evaluating the performance of security controls, identifying new threats, and updating the strategy as necessary.

It's important to note that cybersecurity is an ongoing process, and the CIO advisory team should continuously monitor the organization's IT landscape and recommend updates or changes to the cybersecurity strategy as necessary to protect the organization from cyber threats.
